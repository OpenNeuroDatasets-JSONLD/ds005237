# The Transdiagnostic Connectome Project

A richly phenotyped transdiagnostic dataset with behavioral and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from 241 individuals aged 18 to 70, comprising 148 individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for a broad range of psychiatric illnesses and a healthy comparison group of 93 individuals.

These data include high-resolution anatomical scans and 6 x resting-state, and 3x task-based (2 x Stroop, 1 x Faces/Shapes) functional MRI runs. Participants completed over 50 psychological and cognitive assessments.
